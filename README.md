# Next.js Template Starter

This is an opinionated starter skeleton based on the Advanced Starter of [@agcty](https://github.com/agcty/nextjs-advanced-starter).

Use Tailwind CSS 2.0, Prettier, TypeScript & absolute imports instantly.

## How to use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open on your text editor or IDE.
3. Install dependencies and run the server with "npm run dev" or "yarn dev".

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install

# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Recommended extensions for VSCode

If you're a beginner and don't know which extensions you need, definitely install these:

1. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Adds error highlighting to VSCode.
2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Auto-fixes formatting errors everytime you hit save.
3. [TailwindCSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss): Tailwind className suggestions as you type
4. [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind): Makes sure your tailwind classes have the correct order which makes components easier to read.

## PS

This is a simpler variation of the complete advanced template that you can find [here](https://github.com/agcty/nextjs-advanced-starter).

It was created for a simpler use case in which you don't need more advanced tools like testing or linting.
